## Transparency:
The openness of a Gen AI system's design, development, deployment, operation, inference, decision-making processes, and data sources to stakeholders and end users. This allows the end user to feel confident about how underlying models were trained, whether the underlying data and metadata is sufficient for the use-case and if the system appears to be running as desired. 

### Lineaged:
Having documented history and journey of data, code, and models throughout their lifecycles.

## Explainability:
Having understandable reasons for the decisions that Gen AI makes, the outputs it provides, ensuring that the systems logic is accessible and users can clearly articulate and follow the flow of reasoning that determined the output. This prevents blackbox reasoning and allows the prompter to feel confident around accuracy and risk of output being a hallucinated response.
